# Calculator\n\nThis calculator application takes a mathematical expression as input and renders the result in a visually appealing box in the console.\n\n## How it works:\n\n1.  **Input:** The `main.py` script takes a string expression as a command-line argument.\n2.  **Evaluation:** The `Calculator` class in `pkg/calculator.py` evaluates the expression. It uses an infix evaluation algorithm, handling operator precedence and different mathematical operations (+, -, \*, /).\n3.  **Rendering:** The `render` function in `pkg/render.py` takes the original expression and the calculated result and formats them into a box-like structure using ASCII characters.\n    *   It determines the width of the box based on the length of the expression and the result.\n    *   It constructs the top and bottom borders of the box.\n    *   It adds the expression and the result, padding them with spaces to fit within the box.\n    *   It joins all the lines to form the final output string, which is then printed to the console.\n\n## Example:\n\nTo run the calculator, use the following command:\n\n```bash\npython main.py \"2 * (3 + 4)\"\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n┌─────────────┐\n│  2 * (3 + 4)  │\n│              │\n│  =           │\n│              │\n│  14          │\n└─────────────┘\n```
